# Python-Projects--CSCI-603-
The files under this folder are the mini-projects I have worked on while taking my "Computational Problem Solving" course at Rochester Institute of Technology
This course has built up my skills to handle problems using data structures, error handling, optimization tactics.

1. Turtle library implementation
2. Recursion implementation for fractal antenna
3. Optimized distance of foodtruck placement on a street that uses searching and sorting algorithms
4. Skyscraper data validation using various data structures such as lists, sets and named tuples
5. Mobile (toy) implementation using trees data structure & recusive algorithms along with turtle for better visualization *

*It is a folder since it is a project with multiple files
